Wordgen
=======

**Wordgen** is to generate english like words to use for product and company names.

This is what happens when your product manager is an engineer. :)

It's designed to be used with AWS Lambda, and we highly reccomend deploying with [kappa](https://github.com/garnaat/kappa).

The program was used to come up with the name [Yeobot](https://cloudnative.io/yeobot)
